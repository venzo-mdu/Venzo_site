            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Introduction</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>The most important element in the software development lifecycle is testing, which has the primary goal of ensuring bug-free software that fulfills client requirements. Testing is taxing since it entails manually running test cases against a variety of apps in order to find problems and failures.

But what if the testing process could be automated? That would break up the monotony, and Selenium accomplishes this.</p>
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Emergence of Selenium</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>Manual testing was tedious and uninteresting for Jason Huggins, an engineer at ThoughtWorks in Chicago. He created JavaScriptTestRunner, a JavaScript software for automating web application testing.</p>
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>What actually is selenium?</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>Selenium is an open-source automated testing tool for testing web applications across a range of browsers. Selenium is the preferred technology for automating web application testing, functional regression automation, and creating and managing automated test suites.</p> 
            <img src={selenium2} className='selenium1'/>
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Why Selenium is Most Widely Used Test Automation Tool?</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>
                <ul className='seleinumList'>
                    <li className='seleinumList'>Selenium is mostly written in JavaScript, hence is simple to use.</li>
                    <li className='seleinumList'>Selenium can test web apps in a variety of browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari.</li>
                    <li className='seleinumList'>Tests can be written in a variety of languages, including Java, Python, Perl, PHP, and Ruby.</li>
                    <li className='seleinumList'>Selenium is platform-agnostic, which means it can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.</li>
                    <li className='seleinumList'>Selenium may be used to manage tests with technologies like JUnit and TestNG.</li>
                    <li className='seleinumList'>Selenium can run on your own computer, a third-party cloud server, a server (through selenium remote), or a group of servers (with selenium grid).</li>
                </ul></p> 
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>The Selenium Toolset</p>
            <img src={selenium3} className='selenium1'/>
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>IDE typically records user interactions in the browser and exports them into a script that may be reused.</p> 
            <img src={selenium4} className='selenium1'/>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>DE was created to make writing automation scripts easier. It’s a rapid prototype tool that developers without any programming experience may use.</p> 
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Selenium Remote Control (RC)</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>Selenium RC is a Java server that allows you to write application tests in a variety of computer languages, including Java, C#, Perl, PHP, Python, and others.</p> 
            <img src={selenium5} className='selenium1'/>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>The RC server takes orders from the user application and converts them into Selenium-Core JavaScript commands for the browser.</p> 
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Selenium WebDriver</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>WebDriver communicates natively with browser applications and does not require a core engine like RC. WebDriver also supports a variety of programming languages, including Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl, and may be linked with test management frameworks like TestNG and JUnit.<br></br>
Selenium WebDriver has a straightforward and easy-to-understand architecture:</p> 
            <img src={selenium6} className='selenium1'/>
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Selenium Grid</p>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>Selenium Grid enables the execution of tests in parallel across several browsers and operating systems.</p> 
            <img src={selenium7} className='selenium1'/>
            <p className='seleniumCont'>Grid is extremely adaptable, and it connects with other suite components to allow for concurrent operation.</p> 
            <p className='seleniumTtiel'>How to successfully integrate Selenium Testing Automation?</p>

                    <ul><li className='seleinumList selList'>Outline your revenue model, expected user behavior with the application, and browser types before planning your testing strategy.</li></ul>
                    <li className='seleinumList'><strong>Choose a Programming Language for Test Automation That Is Appropriate</strong></li>
                    <ul><li className='seleinumList selList'>A very crucial step to consider is choosing a suitable programming language for building acceptance tests for your website or application. Consult your application development team to learn about their experiences and skills with a specific language.</li></ul>
