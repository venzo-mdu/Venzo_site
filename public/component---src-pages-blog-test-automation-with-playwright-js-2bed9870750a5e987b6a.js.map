To communicate with different browsers, Playwright employs a variety of protocols. It communicates with Chromium using the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), and it has its own protocols for Firefox and WebKit that are similar to CDP.  </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'><span style={{ fontSize: '15px', fontFamily: 'poppins', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Websocket Protocol : </span>To connect the client and the server, Playwright employs the WebSocket protocol. A process is used to establish the WebSocket connection. </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'>WebSockets have significantly lower latency than long polling. Because WebSockets keep the connection open, real-time communication between the client and server is possible. </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'>The WebSocket protocol establishes a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing communication to take place in both directions. </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'>The WebSocket connection is a stateful protocol, which means that it will remain active until either the client or the server terminates it. Playwright sends all requests between the client and server via a single WebSocket connection, which is considered superior for automation to the Selenium HTTP Connection protocol. </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'><span style={{ fontSize: '15px', fontFamily: 'poppins', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Client Server Communication : </span>When you run a test using Playwright, your test code is converted into a specific format called JSON and sent to the Playwright server using the WebSocket protocol. This protocol allows for faster and more reliable communication between the client and server because it keeps the connection open until all tests are completed. </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'>This is different from other testing frameworks like Selenium, which uses the HTTP protocol to send each command to the server separately. In Selenium, the connection between the server and client is terminated after each request and then re-established for the next request, which can cause delays and lead to test failures.  </p>\n        <p className='seleniumCont'>Because Playwright uses a single connection for all requests, it is faster and less prone to test failures or flakiness. Plus, the commands are executed quickly, which makes Playwright a better choice for cross-browser testing.  </p>\n\n        <img className='selenium1' src={Playwright3} alt='playwright'></img>\n        <p className='seleniumTtiel'>Playwright VS Selenium : </p>\n        <Table className='iconicTable'>\n                    <tr>\n                        <th>Criteria</th>\n                        <th>Playwright</th>\n                        <th>Selenium</th>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Browser Support\t</td>\n                        <td>Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (note: Playwright tests browser projects, not stock browsers) </td>\n                        <td>Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and IE </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Language Support </td>\n                        <td>Java, Python, .NET C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript. </td>\n                        <td>Java, Python, C#, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and JavaScript </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Test Runner Frameworks Support \t</td>\n                        <td>Jest/Jasmine, AVA, Mocha, and Vitest \t</td>\n                        <td>Jest/Jasmine, Mocha, WebDriver IO, Protractor, TestNG, JUnit, and NUnit </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Operating System Support \t</td>\n                        <td>Windows, Mac OS and Linux \t</td>\n                        <td>Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Solaris </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Architecture \t</td>\n                        <td>Headless browser with event-driven architecture \t</td>\n                        <td>4-layer architecture (Selenium Client Library, JSON Wire Protocol, Browser Drivers, and Browsers) </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Integration with CI </td>\n                        <td>Yes</td>\n                        <td>Yes</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Prerequisites \t</td>\n                        <td>NodeJS \t</td>\n                        <td>Selenium Bindings (for your language), Browser Drivers and Selenium Standalone Server </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr'>Real Device Support </td>\n                        <td>Native mobile emulation (and experimental real Android support) \t</td>\n                        <td>Real device clouds and remote servers </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td className='tableClr' >Community Support </td>\n                        <td>Smaller but growing set of community resources \t</td>\n                        <td>Large, established collection of documentation and support options </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </Table>\n\n        <div className='playwrightBg1'>\n        <span className='seleReadmore'>Ready to streamline your testing process?
